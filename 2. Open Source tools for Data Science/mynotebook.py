a = 5
b = 3
sum_result = a + b
sum_result

# Example of multiplication and addition
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result

# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 120
hours = minutes / 60
hours

# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 150  # You can change this value to any number of minutes
hours = minutes / 60
hours
